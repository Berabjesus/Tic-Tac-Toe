# Built With

- Ruby
- Rubocop

### Prerequisites

- Browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari or any other browser)

### Setup
- Open Terminal
- Run git clone https://github.com/abouhid/Tic-Tac-Toe.git
- Run `cd Tic-Tac-Toe`
- Run `ruby bin/main`

### Game instructions
  The player has the option to play or to exit. If the player decides to play, these steps follow:
- Both players choose their names to play against each other
- A 3x3 grid is displayed on the terminal and the first player chooses a number to place his symbol on that number's position
- The players take turns in order to try to make an uninterrupted row, column or diagonal.
- The player which does that first wins!
- If all spaces are chosen and there is no winner, it is considered a draw
- On both situations above, there is the option to restart the game
- Have fun!
